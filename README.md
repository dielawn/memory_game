# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Pokémon API React App

This React application allows users to explore Pokémon characters using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can view details about each Pokémon, including images, stats, and types. The app features a game mode where users can test their knowledge by guessing Pokémon based on images and hints.

## Features

- **Guessing Game:** A game mode where users guess the name of the Pokémon from its image.
- **High Score Tracking:** Keep track of your highest scores in the game mode.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
